Landing page for the startup Savvy Service, an online menu platform for establishments. The main application was developed by me and my team on GitLab, and this is its promotional webpage.

Technology stack:

- html, scss;
- JavaScript;
- Gulp, Webpack
- Figma (design).

Features:

1. The page was developed in a very tight timeframe, just within 3 days.
2. Everything was done according to the designer's layout, with whom I maintained communication.
3. I made an effort to maintain cleanliness in the styles, properly organizing them into files and adding comments for easy future use.
4. The slider was implemented using the js library splidejs, and I wrote the missing logic myself in the script.js file, organizing functions in a separate "functions" folder.
5. For production, a build was created using Gulp and Webpack, which I did not include in this repository.
